Personal project. An app built with SwiftUI that contains information that could be useful when your out and about in your boat at sea! 

## Technology & Architecture :computer: 
- Built using **SwiftUI**
- Uses **SwiftData** for persistant storage
- Built around **MVVM architechture** for organized code (probably overkill for this small project, but I wanted to pretend this was a big, and organize my code as if it was a big project...)
- Utilizing a **custom TabBar** & **custom ViewModifiers**
